**Image Classification & Object Detection from Video (TensorFlow + Keras)**
This project uses a video file as a dataset for performing image classification and object detection. The video is split into frames using OpenCV, then divided into train, validation, and test sets.

Using TensorFlow and Keras, we train deep learning models:

Image Classification: CNN models (e.g., MobileNet) are trained to classify each frame.

Object Detection: Models like SSD or YOLO are used to detect and localize objects in frames.

**Steps:**
Extract frames from video.

Preprocess and split data.

Train classification/detection models.

Evaluate performance.
